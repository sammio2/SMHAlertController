# SMHAlertController
Subclass of UIAlertController which allows it to be used in a similar fashion to the much loved UIAlertView. Display alerts from wherever you are in your code, it doesn't have to be a UIViewController. It also automatically queues your alerts so you can just fire &amp; forget like with UIAlertView.
